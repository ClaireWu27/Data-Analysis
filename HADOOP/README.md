# Hadoop Mini Projects Overview

This repository contains 9 different Hadoop-related tasks covering HDFS operations, MapReduce, Spark, Hive, HBase, Pig, and stream processing. Each task includes a detailed `README.md` file with step-by-step instructions.

## Project List

### **1. HDFS Operations and Python Interface**

1. **HDFS Command-Line Operations**  
   Learn how to interact with HDFS using the command line. This task covers file creation, uploading, manipulation, merging, and deletion.  
   [View Details](./Command%20Line%20Interface%20to%20HDFS/README.md)

2. **Python Interface to HDFS (Snakebite)**  
   Use the Snakebite client library in Python to interact with HDFS. Perform operations such as listing files and folders, retrieving file contents, and managing HDFS data programmatically.

### **2. Data Processing and Querying**

3. **Querying a Data Cube in Hive**  
   Execute SQL queries in Hive using `GROUP BY`, `CUBE`, `ROLLUP`, and window functions to analyze orders and supplier data.  
   [View Details](./Querying%20a%20Data%20Cube/README.md)

4. **Data Processing with Pig Latin**  
   Use Pig Latin to process a one-dimensional data cube containing banking and transaction data. Perform filtering, aggregation, and extraction of meaningful insights.  
   [View Details](./Data%20processing%20with%20Pig%20Latin/README.md)

5. **Data Processing with Spark**  
   Utilize PySpark to process and analyze a denormalized data cube of banks, accounts, and transactions. Work with DataFrames and execute queries efficiently.

### **3. Big Data Processing with MapReduce**

7. **MapReduce Streaming with Python**  
   Implement a Hadoop streaming application using Python. Process sales transaction data using the MapReduce paradigm to compute aggregated statistics.  
   [View Details](./MapReduce%20streaming%20with%20Python/README.md)

8. **HBase Table Design & Querying**  
   Design and implement HBase tables for handling structured data related to recruitment and student assignments. Execute queries using HBase shell commands.
