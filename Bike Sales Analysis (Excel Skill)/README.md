## Overview

This project involves cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data using Excel. The goal is to extract meaningful insights by applying structured data processing techniques.

## Data Cleaning Process

### 1. Handling Missing Values

- Checked for empty or missing values in the dataset.
- Used filtering and conditional formatting to highlight missing values.
- Applied appropriate techniques (removal or imputation) to ensure data integrity.

### 2. Removing Duplicates

- Identified duplicate records using Excelâ€™s built-in **Remove Duplicates** function.
- Verified uniqueness of key identifiers to maintain data quality.

### 3. Standardizing Data

- Corrected inconsistent formatting, such as case differences and whitespace issues.

### 4. Data Type Corrections

- Checked and corrected column data types (dates, numerical values, currency formatting).

### 5. Handling Outliers

- Identified extreme values using **Conditional Formatting** and statistical summary functions(no outlier is identified).

## Data Transformation & Analysis

### 1. Creating New Columns

- Used **IF conditions** for categorical segmentation(add age bracket).

### 2. Using Pivot Tables for Aggregation

- Summarized key metrics, including average income by gender, the number of bikes purchased based on commute distance, and the distribution of bike purchases across different age brackets.

## Data Visualization

### 1. Creating Charts & Graphs

- **Bar Charts**: Visualized the comparison of average income across genders.
- **Line Charts**: Illustrated trends in bike purchases based on commute distance and age brackets.

### 2. Interactive Slicers

- **Marital Status**: Filter results based on whether customers are married or single.
- **Education Level**: Allows filtering based on education categories (Bachelors, Graduate Degree, High School, etc.).
- **Region**: Enables comparison of bike purchases across different geographical locations (Europe, North America, Pacific).

## Key Insights

1. Males purchase bikes more frequently than females.
2. Customers aged 31-54 (Middle Age) are the most likely to buy a bike.
3. Customers with a commute distance of 0-1 mile are more inclined to purchase a bike.
4. Married individuals buy bikes more often than single individuals.
5. Customers with a Graduate Degree tend to purchase bikes more than those with other education levels.
6. Bike purchases are higher in North America compared to Europe and the Pacific regions.
